First of all we introduce the hierarchy of data structures with respect to persistence.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries Ephemeral data structures} Past states are destroyed by new changes and irretrievably lost.
\item {\bfseries Semi-persistent data structures} Past states are stored and can be accessed for reading. Historical versions form a linear order.
\item {\bfseries (Fully-)persistent data structures} Versions form a rooted tree, additional changes can be made to any existing version, creating a new version as a child vertex.
\item {\bfseries Functional data structures} No changes are permitted to written data.
\end{itemize}

This division is by no means universally adopted, but provides an interesting perspective regardless.
