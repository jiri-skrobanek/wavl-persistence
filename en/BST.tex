In this chapter basic, terminology concerning trees will be established. Then a~quick review of weak-AVL (WAVL) trees is given. Next, our modified balancing algorithm is introduced. Finally, weight-balanced trees are defined since these will be needed as an auxiliary structure in persistent binary search trees.

\section{Terminology}

For the purposes of this thesis, \emph{binary search tree} (BST) will be a~data structure composed of internal \emph{vertices} (or nodes). Every internal vertex carries a~\emph{key}. Keys are members of a~set of linearly ordered items and we naturally extend this ordering to vertices. In~addition, internal vertices are allowed to carry constant amount of information in~\emph{fields} (for example about tree structure) and to have constant number of (proper) \emph{pointers} to other vertices. An internal node has two pointers to child vertices -- \emph{left} and \emph{right}. Any of the pointers can target an external vertex. 
External vertices are not represented in memory, all pointers (null-pointers) to external vertices are equal and must not be dereferenced. 
For the specific application, it can be beneficial to assume that external vertices have some default values of their fields. 

Binary search trees naturally represent finite rooted ordered (i.e., order of children is also relevant) trees where every vertex has degree at most three and the root has degree at most two. 
For every vertex $v$ in a BST, all vertices in the subtree induced by left child of $v$ must precede its parent in the linear order, conversely vertices in the subtree induced by left child of $v$ must come after its parent in the linear order. By subtree induced by vertex $u$ we mean the tree with $u$ as the root and all descendants of $u$.

When we work with binary search trees, we typically use a~specific algorithm that only accepts a~specific subclass of BSTs on input. (Think for example 2-3 trees.) Should it modify the BST, the resulting tree will still belong to the same class. Standard operations with BSTs are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Find(Tree, Key)} tries to locate a~vertex with the specified \texttt{Key} in \texttt{Tree} and may return the value of any chosen field in the vertex.
	\item \texttt{Insert(Tree, Key, Value)} creates a~new vertex in \texttt{Tree} with specified \texttt{Key} and \texttt{Value}.
	\item \texttt{Delete(Tree, Key)} removes vertex with specified \texttt{Key} from \texttt{Tree}.
	\item \texttt{Min(Tree)} returns the minimum value over all vertices in \texttt{Tree}.
	\item \texttt{Max(Tree)} returns the maximum value over all vertices in \texttt{Tree}.
	\item \texttt{Predecessor(Tree, Key)} returns the maximum key among vertices of \texttt{Tree} smaller than \texttt{Key}.
	\item \texttt{Successor(Tree, Key)} returns the minimum key among vertices of \texttt{Tree} greater than \texttt{Key}.
\end{itemize}

If none of the latter four operations is required, it is usually better to resort to hashing rather than BSTs. That choice would typically lead to quadratic time complexity in the worst-case though.

Of the operations described here, typically only insert and delete alter the BST. (Splay trees \cite{splay} are a~notable exception to this.) We will call operations that modify the BST {\em updates} or {\em altering} and remaining operations {\em queries} or {\em non-altering}.

\section{Standard operation}

We will mention here a~basic implementation for some of those basic tree operations. This will also be the implementation used by modified WAVL trees, which will be defined later. The reader is expected to be mostly familiar with these operations already. Detailed description is attached in an appendix for reference.

\subsubsection*{Find}
Search for a~key $k$ begins by assigning the root to a~current vertex variable $v$. If $v$ has the searched key, the vertex is found. Otherwise if $k$ is greater than the key of $v$. We try to move the right child of $v$, otherwise to the left child. If we were to move an external vertex, we report that $k$ is not present in the tree.

\subsubsection*{Insert}
The place where a~vertex should be inserted is uniquely determined in all BSTs. Descending from the root going to the left child if the key being inserted is lower than the key of current vertex, to the right child otherwise. This is repeated until a~null-pointer is reached -- which will replaced by pointer to the new vertex. 

After the change a~process of \textit{rebalancing} will typically follow. The goal of this process is to ensure that the tree remains in the correct class of BSTs, modifying it when needed.

\subsubsection*{Delete}
For deletion, the vertex $v$ subject to deletion is located first using find. If it only has external children, it is simply deleted. If it has only one internal child, it is deleted and the child becomes direct child of $v$'s parent. Otherwise the predecessor of $v$ is found, it cannot have two children, so it is possible to swap key and value between those vertices and then run the deletion again, this time certainly removing a~vertex. After a~vertex is deleted, rebalancing follows.

We will also describe here one common rebalancing step which is a rotation.

\subsubsection*{Rotate}

For a~vertex $y$ with parent $p$ and left child $x$ and right subtree $C$ where $x$ has left subtree $A$ and right subtree $B$, a~rotate step (or rotation) along $xy$ makes $x$ to have parent $p$, left subtree $A$ and right child $y$. Subsequently, $y$ gets left subtree $B$ and keeps its right subtree $C$.

For symmetry, rotating along $xy$ again from the resulting state, we would get the original tree before any rotations.
