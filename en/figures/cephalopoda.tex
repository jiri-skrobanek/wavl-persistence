	\caption{Fictitious phylogenesis of Cephalopoda}
	Taxonomic units are ordered by the time of speciation (left to right) and connected by supposed ancestry. (Biological facts were heavily modified by the author.)
	Assuming a query for $v =$ \emph{Chaetodermomorpha} and $s$ represented by the dashed vertical line, \emph{Mollusca} and \emph{Phoronida} are found to be lower and upper bound in the appropriate version of the persistent tree, of which \emph{Mollusca} is found to be ancestor of $v$ through LCA. Finding LCAs of its children and $v$, it is discovered that \emph{Aculifera} is the answer.
