\def\Abstract{%
Persistence, i.e. preservation of data by updates, has been an interesting topic in the study of data structures. 
This thesis investigates persistence of binary search trees. 
In particular we explore how weak-AVL trees may be converted into efficient fully-persistent data structures.
After mentioning all important properties of weak-AVL trees, we present a new method to store them with worst-case constant number of changes per update. 
We then show a general scheme for conversion of pointer-based data structures into their persistent variants. Finally this scheme is used to obtain fully-persistent weak-AVL trees.
