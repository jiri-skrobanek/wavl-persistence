To state the algorithms described in more exact manner the author implemented alternative balancing for WAVL-trees and persistent WAVL-trees as an attachment to this thesis. The format chosen was C\# libraries for .NET Standard platform.

The goal of the implementation is solely to provide additional clarity into the algorithms. No special optimization has been carried out as this would likely only hinder understanding. It is not intended that someone would include the library in own project, nonetheless that is also possible.
